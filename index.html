                <p> I went to Japan in late may to early June for a total of 2 weeks. The plan was to hit tokyo, kyoto, and osaka. Trying to spread out an even amount of time between the three cities. Most of my friends have only ever been to Tokyo and spend huge swaths of time there. They rave about the place of course, but when I ask about the other two cities I got silence. It was just as well, though. I think not knowing what Kyoto or Osaka had in store for helped with the suprise I guess. I've always been into the Japanese culture a bit. Of course I loved their cartoons when I was younger, but  since I spent my alot of my life playing video games, it was the way they made those games that drew me alot towards the country.  It turns out that alot of my favorite arcade style video games are made by the japanese. 
                        When me and my sister landed in Tokyo, it was a bit surreal. It seemed like a small island from up above in the plane but as soon as we landed it became bigger and bigger until until completely surrounded me. My sister's work netted her crazy points so we wound up staying at the hilton hotel in tokyo. It was know for their amazing pastry buffets. That week was their strawberry festival. And boy, it was open for business.  I proably gained a huge plus 100 to my diabetes meter but it was worth it.  For breakfast we got to eat at their executive platinum lounge where we got to see a not too shabby view of the tokyo skyline.
                        We went to harajuku the next day. I'll be honest, My sister and I were pretty bored. It looked neat enough but it kinda reminded me of the shopping area right outside the alamo in san antonio randomly enough.  Just alot of gift shops and clothing stores with clothing that would never fit us.  I think the two standouts from my tokyo trip were yoyogi park and akhihabra. I feel like 15 year old me would have been in heaven in a place like super potato. A place that had retro video games as their stock and trade. The top floor had an arcade where could play a whole bunch of stuff. 
                        Yoyogi Park was a really nice jaunt into nature. Only 100&yen;! A good contrast from the urban, um...urbaness that was tokyo. There was a big shinto shrine and an old teahouse. Little did I know it was going to be taste of things to come later in my trip.

                <p>It took us three hours by shinkansen(bullet train) to get to Kyoto. I remember it being fairly late in the night. It was an incredibly comfortable ride, and looking at the countryside of Japan was very thrilling to see. One semmingly crazy to me thing that we saw was a costco.. It looked so agonizingly normal and run of the mill after the utter differences i felt in tokyo I almost wondered if I was back and ballwin and my dad was in that costco buying an absurd amount of einstein bagels.
                        Anyway once we hit kyoto at what seemed to be really really late at night we stayed at hotel ailmont. a really small scale yet cozy place which gave us a good view at the more modest but no less beautfil kytoto. They served kyoto style breakfast in the morning, with all sorts of fish and tofu and comforting soup. After that was a trip some of the most breath taking sights I have ever seen. From bamboo forest to lakes to temple shinto and buddists alike, I felt like I anted to just live in kyoto.  Everything seemed at least from the outside so mellow and so peaceful, that I wished I could stay longer.  But it wasn't to be. He had osaka to go to but before that, we had to experince a day in hiiroshima, more specifically, miyajima island. There, the big sights were free roaming deer that messed with you, a huge tori gate amonsgt the water and the best okonmiyaki would ever had. It was my sisters first time and she was hooked. After a trip to hirshima bomb museum and somber reflection we headed to osaka.

                <h2>Osaka</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Osaka we stayed at the best western in shinsaibashi, which is a really happening district in Osaka.  It was only a few blocks away from the famous dotenbori street.  Home to tons of resteraunts and the like. Some of the biggest and best sushi in Japan was had here. Osaka is basically a foodies dream and I fell like if I had to live anywhere it would be here. It had a nice mix of tokyo's bustle and kyoto neighborly warmth. and plus, kyoto itself was only an hour away.  I think to be honest though, I enjoyed simply meandering the streets of shinsaibashi the most. Just seeing all the ins and outs of people going about to whereever teh heck they wer going alongside narrow hallway like streets. Tokyo wards like shibuya and shinjuku were fun but had a huge mtropolitan impersonal feel. Osaka wasn't really llike that. everything felt alot more close together, people and the buildings included like it felt so close, even though of course my real hokme may have been a million miles away. I think I'll miss that connective feeling the most.  At any rate. If you have the means in time. I can't recommend enough the importance of vistiing at least these three cities. Japan is not all about Tokyo.  It's even more than these cities. I would like to go to sendai next time. Okinawa and hokkaido are on my wishlist. Especially Hokkaido. Being from St. Louis doens't give me the best access to seafood, so hokkaido is a star on my wishlist.  
                        Japan, It was nice to meet you. Hopefully we meet again very soon.
